            <p>I was recently diagnosed to be on the Autism Spectrum Disorder at age 30. My spouse and I aren't too affected by it because pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis, I am still the same person I'd always been, and the diagnosis only brought to light what had been there all along. The diagnosis however, helps explain why it has been hard for me to be in social communities like church.</p>
          
            <h3>Some of the things I struggle with:</h3>
          
            <ul>
              <li>Knowing what to say. Simple questions like "How are you?" that are open-ended are hard to answer.</li>
              <li>Too much stimulation (e.g. big groups of people talking)</li>
              <li>Enjoying activities. Many things do not interest me.</li>
              <li>Understanding jokes & sarcasm.</li>
              <li>Mental rigidity. I don't think I am stubborn, but I have trouble changing paradigms.</li>
              <li>Anxiety and general awkwardness around people from the above.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h3>Over the years, I have learnt to fake it till I make it (i.e. masking), so I have rehearsed responses (and even questions to ask people!).</h3>
          
            <p>This diagnosis provides for me a new category to "classify" the difficulty for me to be genuinely concerned about the lives of others. In the past, I used to think that it's "sanctification", but now there's the category of "autism". These boxes aren't binary however, and the right way to view it is probably somewhere along the spectrum.</p>
          
            <p>Here's an <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/church-autism-spectrum-disorder/">article</a> on another Christian's experience of doing church with autism</p>

            <h3>FAQ:</h3>
          
            <ul>
              <li>Why I went for the Autism assessment: Read an article on The Gospel Coalition (can't find the article now) about a Christian diagnosed with autism in adulthood years, and as I read through the list of symptoms, it felt like I was reading about myself. Since then, I had the thought of going for diagnosis.</li>
