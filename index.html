            <p>I was recently diagnosed to be on the Autism Spectrum Disorder at age 30. My spouse and I aren't too affected
          by it because pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis, I am still the same person I'd always been, and the diagnosis only
          brought to light what had been there all along. The diagnosis however, helps explain why it has been hard for me
          to be in social communities like church.</p>
          
            <h3>Some of the things I struggle with:</h3>
          
            <ul>
              <li>Knowing what to say. Simple questions like "How are you?" that are open-ended are hard to answer.</li>
              <li>Understanding jokes & sarcasm.</li>
              <li>Mental rigidity. I don't think I am stubborn, but I have trouble changing paradigms.</li>
              <li>Anxiety (perhaps from the above), and general awkwardness around people.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h3>Over the years, I have learnt to fake it till I make it (i.e. masking), so I have rehearsed responses (and
          even questions to ask people!).</h3>
          
            <p>This diagnosis provides for me a new category to "classify" the difficulty for me to be genuinely concerned
          about the lives of others. In the past, I used to think that it's "sanctification", but now there's the category
          of "autism". These boxes aren't binary however, and the right way to view it is probably somewhere along the
          spectrum.</p>
