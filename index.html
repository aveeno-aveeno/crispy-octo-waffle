            <p>I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at age 30. My spouse and I aren't too affected by it because I am still the same person I'd always been, and the diagnosis only brought to light what had been there all along. The diagnosis however, helps explain why it has been hard for me to be in social communities like church.</p>

            <p>I wasn't even aware that I may be autistic. I used to think that I am not good at socialising because I only have narrow interests, so when people talk about many different things, I am naturally unable to meaningfully participate in it. To fit in, I have learnt to "fake it till I make it" in social situations (i.e. masking), including rehearsed questions & responses.</p>

            <p>A couple of years ago, I happened to read an article on The Gospel Coalition (can't find the article now) about a Christian diagnosed with autism in adulthood years. As I read through the list of symptoms that the author wrote of himself, I felt like I was reading about myself. Since then, I had the thought of going for diagnosis, which I eventually did in end 2024.</p>

            <p>This diagnosis provides for me a new category to "classify" the difficulty for me to be genuinely concerned about the lives of others. In the past, I used to think that it's "sanctification", but now there's the category of "autism". These boxes aren't binary however, and the right way to view it is probably somewhere along the spectrum (no pun intended).</p>

            <p>Some of the things I struggle with:</p>
          
            <ul>
              <li>Knowing what to say. Simple but open-ended questions like "How are you?" are hard to answer because my mind is literally blank.</li>
              <li>Too much stimulation (e.g. noise, clutter, lights).</li>
              <li>Enjoying activities. Many things do not interest me.</li>
              <li>Understanding jokes & sarcasm.</li>
              <li>Mental rigidity. I don't think I am stubborn, but I have trouble changing paradigms.</li>
              <li>Anxiety and general awkwardness from the above.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I used to think that I am just extremely introverted (results from personality tests also indicate that I am 90% on the introversion scale, for example), but I no longer think that's the case. Generally, talking with people do not energise me, regardless whether it's in a big group or small group. One of the key reasons is because I am generally uninterested in what they talk about (though I still try my very best to be interested). I also prefer being alone not because I find enjoyment in it, but because I don't have to suffer the pain of having an over-stimulated mind.</p>

            <p>That said, I am thankful that I grew up in church and was perpetually "forced" to interact with people. From the angle of personal formation, without the compulsion of love from being in a Christian community, I would likely have been a much more reserved person and much less able to interact with people.</p>

            <p>Here's an <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/church-autism-spectrum-disorder/">article</a> on another Christian's experience of doing church with autism, which describes to some extent how I feel in church too.</p>

            <p>I recently saw my dermatologist for my eczema condition. He told me that there's 0% chance for my eczema to be permanently healed. He also said something along the line of, "if you have eczema but you can eat, have fun, work and sleep, hallelujah already". Regarding autism, the similar idea applies: that I can be married, be educated and gainfully employedas a Software Engineer, able to still have some friends - hallelujah!</p>
